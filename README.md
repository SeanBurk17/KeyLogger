This is a basic keylogger that I used to practice working with low level keyboard hooks and the Windows API.

It is developed in C, and was made for 32/64 bit Windows systems. It uses UTF-8 encoding to write keystrokes to log.txt.

DISCLAIMER:
This project is strictly for educational purposes and was made to be ran on authorized testing devices. Not only is running this keylogger without permission illegal, it would be very dumb to do so, as it is easily detected and the names logger.exe and log.txt are blatantly malicious. Please use this program responsibly, and note that I do not claim any responsibility, and do not condone, any illegal, malicous, or otherwise unethical acts that this program is used for.
